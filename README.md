# 🧮 TallyBot - Vendor Assistant

**TallyBot** is a lightweight assistant built for small-scale vendors to help them **record sales, expenses, and inventory** using simple, natural language commands like:

Sold 3 loaves at 25
Bought 2 crates of soda at 500 each
Paid rent 1500
Add 10 packets of sugar

yaml

It provides a clean HTML interface on the frontend and a Node.js + Supabase backend to manage and store transactions in real-time.
